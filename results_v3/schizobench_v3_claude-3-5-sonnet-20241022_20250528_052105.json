Reality itself could no longer be trusted. Every glitch would raise existential questions:\n\n- Is our universe a simulation with failing code?\n- Are we in a dying reality beginning to break down?\n- Are these glitches glimpses of other dimensions bleeding through?\n- Has someone or something begun hacking the fabric of spacetime?\n\nThe protagonist might try to:\n- Document and study the patterns of glitches\n- Find others who can see them\n- Learn to predict or even manipulate the errors\n- Track down their source/cause\n- Deal with being seen as insane by others\n- Prevent reality from completely unraveling\n\nThe story could explore themes of:\n- The nature of consciousness and perception\n- What defines \"real\" vs \"simulated\"\n- Human adaptability to impossible situations\n- The limits of rational explanation\n- Individual vs collective reality\n\nLet me know if you would like me to expand on any of these aspects!",
