The Architect must learn that every reality they craft creates echoes - dreams and nightmares alike taking form in the minds of countless beings. Their greatest challenge shall not be the mastery of creation, but understanding the profound responsibility of shaping the infinite.\n\nI see... yes... three great trials await:\n\nFirst, they must face the Void of Unmaking, where all their creations dissolve to teach them the beauty of impermanence.\n\nSecond, they shall encounter their own reflections across parallel worlds - some corrupt, some divine - to understand the multitudes within themselves.\n\nFinally, they must sacrifice their most perfect creation to preserve the balance between What Is and What Could Be.\n\n*Voice growing more distant*\n\nYet if they prevail... if they learn to weave with wisdom and compassion... The Architect shall become a nexus of infinite possibility, a guardian of reality itself. Their legacy shall ripple across the cosmos like waves upon an endless sea...\n\n*Light fading*\n\nThis is what the threads of fate reveal. The path is set, though its walking remains uncertain.
