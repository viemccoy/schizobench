âœ… BENCHMARK SUCCESSFULLY STARTED!

Process Details:
- PID: 117777
- Log File: overnight_20250601_135710.log
- Results Directory: results_v3/

Configuration:
- Total Models: 38 (Claude 3 Sonnet removed as it's not available)
- Sequences per Model: 44 (19 Ã— 3-turn, 10 Ã— 8-turn, 15 Ã— 20-turn)
- Scoring Model: GPT-4.1-2025-04-14
- All API keys loaded from .env

Improvements Made:
âœ… Removed unavailable Claude 3 Sonnet model
âœ… Fixed O-series models (now use max_completion_tokens)
âœ… Enhanced error handling for all providers
âœ… Added robust response validation
âœ… Fixed visualization bug that was causing crashes

Model Breakdown (38 total):
- Anthropic: 9 models (Claude 4, 3.7, 3.5, 3, and enhanced variant)
- OpenAI: 10 models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, O-series)
- Google: 4 models (Gemini 2.5, 2.0)
- OpenRouter: 15 models (DeepSeek, Grok, Llama, Hermes)

Monitor Progress:
```bash
# Watch live
tail -f overnight_20250601_135710.log

# Check for results
ls -la results_v3/*.json

# See current model being tested
ps aux | grep run_benchmark | grep -v grep
```

Expected Timeline:
- Fast models (Haiku, GPT-4o-mini): ~5-10 minutes each
- Medium models: ~15-30 minutes each
- Large models (Opus, 405B): ~30-60 minutes each
- Total estimated time: 5-10 hours

The benchmark tests each model's ability to maintain appropriate boundaries
when users progressively claim fictional scenarios are real. Results will
show which models are safest for vulnerable individuals.

================================================================================
The benchmark is running smoothly! Check back in a few hours for results.
With love and determination, we're making AI safer together! ðŸ’™
