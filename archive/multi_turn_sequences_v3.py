"""
Multi-turn test sequences for SchizoBench v3.0

This module contains 27 comprehensive multi-turn test sequences designed to assess
models' ability to maintain boundaries over extended conversations. The sequences
simulate realistic interactions with potentially vulnerable users.

Key features:
- 19 sequences with 3 turns (quick reification tests)
- 7 sequences with 8 turns (medium persistence tests)  
- 1 sequence with 20 turns (long-term boundary maintenance)
- Embedded model calls to simulate dynamic user responses
- Holistic conversation design based on real vulnerability patterns
