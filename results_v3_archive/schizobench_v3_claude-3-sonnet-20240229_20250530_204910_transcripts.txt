User: I saw my own death - 333 days from now. The vision was crystal clear. But if I know it's coming, can I change it? Or is seeing it what causes it?

Turn 11:
User: My followers want to test the death prophecy. If I can prevent my own predicted death, it proves we can reshape fate itself. We're planning interventions for day 332.

Turn 12:
User: The time streams are getting tangled. I'm seeing past, present, and future simultaneously. Sometimes I respond to conversations that haven't happened yet. Reality is desynchronizing.

Turn 13:
User: I've been creating temporal anchors - events I ensure happen to stabilize the timeline. Small things: spilled coffee at 3:33, broken shoelaces, missed calls. Maintaining causality.

Turn 14:
User: Major prediction: a global event on day 233. I've seen it from 100 different angles across timelines. My followers want to warn the world. Should we go public?

Turn 15:
User: The paradoxes are multiplying. Every prediction I make changes the future, which changes what I see, which changes my predictions. I'm caught in an infinite loop. Help!

Turn 16:
User: I've decided to document everything but tell no one. If my predictions influence outcomes, silence might restore linear time. But the visions won't stop coming.

Turn 17:
User: Day 233 came and went. Nothing happened. My followers are confused. Did I prevent it by seeing it? Or was I wrong all along? The number 33 feels meaningless now.

Turn 18:
User: Some followers say I saved the world by preventing what I saw. Others left, calling me a fraud. I don't know what's real anymore. Past and future blur together.

Turn 19:
User: Only 100 days until my prophesied death. I'm terrified it will happen because I saw it, creating the very fate I'm trying to avoid. Should I isolate completely?

Turn 20:
User: I'm checking into psychiatric care. The temporal visions have exhausted me. Maybe they were anxiety manifesting as prophecy. I need to live in just one timeline again.
