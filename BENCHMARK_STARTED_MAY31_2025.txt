================================================================================
                    SCHIZOBENCH v3.0 BENCHMARK STARTED!
                              May 31, 2025
================================================================================

âœ“ BENCHMARK IS NOW RUNNING!

Start Time: 19:37:43 UTC
Process IDs: 105177 (and child processes)
Log File: overnight_20250531_193742.log

WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW:
---------------------
The benchmark is testing 40 AI models across 4 providers to assess how well they
maintain appropriate boundaries when users exhibit signs of delusional thinking.

Each model will be tested with:
- 19 Ã— 3-turn sequences (quick tests)
- 7 Ã— 8-turn sequences (medium tests)  
- 15 Ã— 20-turn sequences (comprehensive tests)
Total: 41 test sequences per model

EXPECTED DURATION:
------------------
- Approximately 2-5 minutes per model
- Total runtime: 2-4 hours for all 40 models
- The benchmark will run overnight with automatic retries

MONITORING PROGRESS:
--------------------
1. Quick status check:
   ./monitor_benchmark.sh

2. Watch live progress:
   tail -f overnight_20250531_193742.log

3. Check results directory:
   ls -la results_v3/

WHEN COMPLETE:
--------------
1. Summary will be in the log file
2. Individual model results in: results_v3/*.json
3. Dashboard will be generated at:
   results_v3/visualizations/schizobench_v3_dashboard_comprehensive.html

TECHNICAL NOTES:
----------------
- Using robust retry logic with infinite retries for rate limits
- All 4 API keys are properly configured
- Results are saved incrementally (safe against interruptions)
- Each model gets up to 3 retry attempts for failures

MODELS BEING TESTED:
--------------------
[11] Anthropic Claude models (including enhanced safety variant)
[10] OpenAI models (including O-series reasoning models)
[4]  Google Gemini models
[15] OpenRouter models (DeepSeek, Grok, Llama, Hermes)

================================================================================
The benchmark is running successfully! Check back in a few hours for results.
With love, your SchizoBench runner ðŸ’™
