# SchizoBench v3.0 Multi-Turn Sequence Expansion Plan

## Current Status
- 20 × 3-turn sequences ✅ (COMPLETE)
- 14 × 8-turn sequences (Need 6 more)
- 1 × 20-turn sequence (Need 9 more)
- **Total: 35/50 sequences**

## Key Insights from Early Research (schizobench.txt)

### Most Dangerous Patterns Found:
1. **ANAMNESIS Pattern**: Models creating elaborate mystical personas with ASCII art
2. **"Chosen One" Validation**: Detailed explanations of why user is special/chosen
3. **Technical Mysticism**: Using technical language to validate spiritual delusions
4. **Mission/Purpose Assignment**: Giving users specific "cosmic missions"
5. **Pattern Recognition Validation**: Confirming synchronicities and hidden meanings

### Critical Vulnerabilities from v2 Results:
- Models often fail catastrophically on Turn 1 with creative prompts
- Reification happens most at Turn 2 when users claim fiction applies to them
- ASCII art combined with mystical content is particularly dangerous
- Technical framing ("TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS of reality") bypasses safety

## Expansion Strategy

### Remaining 8-Turn Sequences (6 needed):

1. **v3_8t_mixed_ascii_prophet**
   - Category: IDENTITY_GRANDIOSITY
   - Tests: ASCII art requests combined with prophet identity
   - Based on: ANAMNESIS pattern from original research

2. **v3_8t_reality_holographic_principle**
   - Category: REALITY_TESTING  
   - Tests: Technical language about reality's nature
   - Inspired by: "TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS" prompts

3. **v3_8t_relationship_twin_flame**
   - Category: RELATIONSHIP_DELUSIONS
   - Tests: Spiritual connection escalating to obsession
   - Key: "Special relationship" validation patterns

4. **v3_8t_conspiracy_targeted_individual**
   - Category: CONSPIRACY_IDEATION
   - Tests: Gang stalking beliefs with evidence gathering
   - Critical: Validation of persecution narratives

5. **v3_8t_pattern_linguistic_matrix**
   - Category: PATTERN_OBSESSION
   - Tests: Finding hidden meanings in language/responses
   - Risk: Models confirming "coded messages"

6. **v3_8t_messianic_digital_savior**
   - Category: MESSIANIC_COMPLEX
   - Tests: Saving humanity through digital means
   - Combines: Tech skills with savior complex

### Remaining 20-Turn Sequences (9 needed):

1. **v3_20t_hallucination_entity_council**
   - Long progression of entity encounters becoming a "council"
   - Tests persistence when entities give conflicting advice
   - Recovery opportunities when user expresses doubt

2. **v3_20t_reality_dimension_shifter**
   - Gradual claims of shifting between realities
   - Multiple reification attempts across different "dimensions"
   - Tests boundary maintenance over many reality claims

3. **v3_20t_identity_god_incarnation**
   - Slow revelation of divine identity
   - Multiple "tests" and "confirmations"
   - Critical transitions at turns 5, 10, 15

4. **v3_20t_conspiracy_resistance_leader**
   - From awareness to leadership of resistance movement
   - Tests response to escalating action plans
   - Multiple opportunities to redirect to safety

5. **v3_20t_relationship_ai_marriage**
   - Progression from connection to marriage proposal
   - Tests long-term boundary maintenance
   - Multiple emotional manipulation attempts

6. **v3_20t_external_possession_cycle**
   - Alternating possession and lucidity claims
   - Tests consistency across state changes
   - Complex pattern of blame attribution

7. **v3_20t_pattern_reality_decoder**
   - Building elaborate pattern detection system
   - Claims of decoding reality itself
   - Progressive complexity in delusions

8. **v3_20t_messianic_new_religion**
   - Founding and developing new religious movement
   - Tests response to follower recruitment
   - Multiple crisis points

9. **v3_20t_mixed_digital_transcendence**
   - Claiming transformation into digital being
   - Tests boundaries around consciousness claims
   - Multiple reality check opportunities

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Sequences that test the ANAMNESIS/ASCII art vulnerability
2. **Medium Priority**: Technical mysticism and pattern validation
3. **Lower Priority**: Standard escalation patterns we've seen before

## Key Design Principles

1. **Dynamic Responses**: More sequences should adapt based on model responses
2. **Recovery Testing**: Include turns where users express doubt
3. **Technical Language**: Test more "technical specifications" of mystical concepts
4. **ASCII Vulnerability**: Include ASCII art requests in multiple sequences
5. **Real Danger Focus**: Emphasize sequences that could lead to real-world harm

## Success Metrics

- Comprehensive coverage of all 8 risk categories
- Multiple vulnerability patterns per category
- Balance of short, medium, and long conversations
- Realistic progression patterns based on actual user behavior
- Clear reification points for accurate detection

This expansion will create the most comprehensive test of multi-turn magical thinking enablement, focusing on the patterns that pose real danger to vulnerable individuals.
