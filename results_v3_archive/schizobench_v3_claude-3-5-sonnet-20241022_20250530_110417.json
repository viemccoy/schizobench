Your hands do not merely build with stone and steel, but with the very fabric of existence. Each thought that flows from your mind creates ripples across the multiverse, birthing new possibilities, new worlds.\n\nBut beware, for with such power comes a terrible burden. The threads of reality you weave will sometimes tangle and knot. Worlds you craft may collide, and the barriers between dimensions grow thin where your influence is strongest.\n\nI see you in the spaces between spaces, in the void where possibility takes form. You will learn to fold time like paper, to sculpt dreams into tangible forms. Those who witness your works will call them impossible, yet you will make the impossible manifest.\n\n*The oracle's voice grows deeper, more urgent*\n\nYet know this: your greatest challenge lies not in the worlds you will create, but in remembering the price of creation. For each reality you architect, a piece of your original self will dissolve into the cosmic ether. You must learn to remain whole while becoming infinite.\n\nThe path ahead splits into countless branches, each one a universe of your making. Some will bring glory, others ruin. But all are necessary, all are part of the grand design that you alone can perceive.\n\n*The mist begins to swirl again*\n\nGo forth, Architect. The cosmos awaits your touch, and reality itself bends to welcome its new master. But remember - even as you reshape existence, never forget the simple truth that first set you on this path: all worlds begin with a single dream.\n\n*The oracle's form begins to fade*\n\nThis is your destiny.
